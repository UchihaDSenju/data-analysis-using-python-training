The objective of this assignment is to develop a solid understanding of Numpy array operations. In this assignment you will:\n","> \n","> 1. Pick 5 interesting Numpy array functions by going through the documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html \n","> 2. Run and modify this Jupyter notebook to illustrate their usage (some explanation and 3 examples for each function). Use your imagination to come up with interesting and unique examples.\n","> 3. Upload this notebook to your Jovian profile using `jovian.commit` and make a submission here: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations\n","> 4.
